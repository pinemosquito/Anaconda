# Anaconda

## Using Anaconda (“Conda”) to Supplement Python
Anaconda is a open source platform that is customizable and simplify package management for Python

### Check Anaconda Version and Install

```
The first step is to open Terminal and check to see if you have Anaconda installed. 
If not, we will install it. To check the version, follow the following commands.

A. Open Terminal
B. Check Version

The syntax to access Anaconda on the command line is simply ‘conda’. 
To check the version you have installed, use the following:

conda info
          platform : osx-64
          conda version : 4.3.30
          
conda update conda
          The following packages will be UPDATED:
                    anaconda: 5.0.1-py36h6e48e2d_1  --> custom-py36ha4fed55_0
                    conda:    4.3.30-py36h173c244_0 --> 4.4.7-py36_0         
                    pycosat:  0.6.2-py36h1486600_0  --> 0.6.3-py36hee92d8f_0 
          proceed ([y]/n)? y
```
### Managing packages
```
Use the Terminal or an Anaconda Prompt for the following steps.
To confirm that a package has been added or removed, view a list of packages and versions installed in an environment:

conda list
```
