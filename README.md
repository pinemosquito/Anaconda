# Anaconda

## Using Anaconda (“Conda”) to Supplement Python
Python is a valuable scripting language for data analysis and management; however managing a Python project environment can be nuanced and tricky. Anaconda is a platform built to complement Python by creating customizable and easily accessible environments in which you can run Python scripts.

### Check Anaconda Version and Install

```
The first step is to open Terminal and check to see if you have Anaconda installed. 
If not, we will install it. To check the version, follow the following commands.

A. Open Terminal
B. Check Version

The syntax to access Anaconda on the command line is simply ‘conda’. 
To check the version you have installed, use the following:

conda info

          platform : osx-64
          conda version : 4.3.30
          
```
